                    My name is Michael Zeleney, I was born in Detroit but I lived in Clinton Township my entire life. I enjoy working on computers and programming/developing. Outside of computers I like to play hockey, dirtbike, and snowboard.
                     My current professional affiliation is with two companies. The first being Advance Auto Parts, and the second is a company called Levy where I work in IT out of Ford Field. I have worked many jobs in the past, but none of them were what I really want to do.
                     Some of them were related to cars, which I like to work on in my spare time, but thats not ultimately what I want to do in life. My professional goals would to one day be self employed, but I know that is a difficult task in this particular field of work.
                     Apart from that, I really enjoy working on computers and coding so I would like to become a developer, I enjoy video games so I thought about the possibility of game development, but im not quite sure where I want to end up yet.
                     To find out more about me checkout my <a href="html/my_resume.html">Resume</a> or <a href="html/my_fun_facts.html">Fun Facts</a> about me pages.
